# YOLO Object Detection and Tracking

This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with OpenCV and pre-trained weights.

## Overview

The project uses YOLOv3, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect objects in real-time from a video feed. YOLOv3 is known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications. The code utilizes OpenCV's `dnn` module to load the pre-trained YOLO model and perform object detection on video frames captured from a webcam.
